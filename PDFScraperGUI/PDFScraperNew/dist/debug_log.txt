DATA QUALIFIERS THAT MAY APPLY:

A= Valus reported is an average of two or more determinations.

B = Resulls based upon colony counts autside the ideal range.

H = Value based on field kit datermination. Results may not be accurate,
{= Reported value is between the laboratory MDL and the PQL.
‘stimated value. Surrogate recovery limits exceeded,

K = Off-scale low. Value is known ta be < the value reported.
L = Off-scale high. Value is known to be > the value reported.
N = Presumptive evidence of presence of material,

O = Sampled, but analysis lost or not performed.

Q = Sample held beyond accepted hold time.

NOTES:

MBAS calculated as LAS; motecular weight = 340.
PQL = 4xMDL,
ND = Not detected at or above the adjusted reporting limit.

T = Value reported is < MDL, Reported for informational purposes only and shall not be used
in statistical analysis.

Us Analyte analyzed but not detected at the value indicated,

V = Analyte detected in sample and method blank. Results for this analyte in associated
samples may be biased high. Standard, Duplicate and Spike values are within control limits.
Reported data are usable,

Y = Analysis performed on an improperly preserved sample, Data may be inaccurate.

Z= Too many colonies were present (TNTC). The numeric value represents the filtration volume,
| = Data deviate from historically established concentration ranges.

?-= Data rejected and should not be used. Some or all of QC data were outside criteria, and
the presence or absence of the analyte cannot be determined from the data.

* = Not reported due to interference.

Oil & Grease - If client does not send sufficient sample quantity for spike evaluation surface
water samples are supplied by the laboratory.

COMMENTS:

G1 = Accuracy standard does not meet method control limits, but does meet lab contro! limits

that are in agreement with USEPA generated data, USEPA lelter available upon requost. ,
G2 = Accuracy standard exceads acceptable contro! limits. Duplicate and spike values are

within control limits. Reported data are usable.

Chlorine residual at time of collection:

“Sample Type" is used to indicate whether the sample was a grab (G) or whether it was a composite (C).
“Container Type” is used to indicate whether the container is plastic (P) or glass (G).

‘manufacturing stage. 4OmL. vials are pre-preserved at manufacturing stage.

All bottles not containing preservative may be rinsed with appropriate sample prior to collection.
‘The client is responsible for documentation of the sampling cvent. Please note special sampling events on the sample custody form,
‘Sample kit has been created by BEA using new, certifiedboitles.

Samples received on ice:

‘Sample must be refrigerated or stored in wet ice after collection. The temperature during storage should be less than or equal to G°C (42.8°F).
Under “Preservative,” list any preservatives that were added to the simple container. Lot Number of preservative used is specific to the boitles included in the kit. NaThio, H,SO, and HNO; do not have expiration dates per the manufucturer. Micro boitles are pre-preserved at -——————_——--—

Laboratory Sample Acceptability:

Each bottle has a label identifying sample ID, premeasured preservative contained in the bottle, sample type, client ID, and parameters for analysis
‘The following information should be added to cach bottle label after collection with permanent black ink: date and time of collection, sampler's name or initials, and any field number or ID.

Turbidity at time of collection:

“Sample Matrix” is used to indicate whether the sample is being discharged to drinking water (DW), groundwater (GW), surface water (SW). fresh surface water (FSW), saline surface water (SSW), soil, sediment (SDMNT), or sludge (SLDG).
